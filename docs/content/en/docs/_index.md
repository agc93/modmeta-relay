Welcome to the User Guide for the ModMeta Relay project! Navigate the documentation using the links on the sidebar.

Documentation for how to get started with the server, as well as how to build your own plugins, are available. Remember, these docs are also [open-source](https://github.com/agc93/modmeta-relay) and contributions are always welcome!
